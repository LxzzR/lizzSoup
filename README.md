# Hi! I'm Lizz (they.them), a fellow code nerd ðŸ¤“ ðŸŒˆ 
I believe that user experience and accessibility advocates need strong allies in web developers, devs who believe that making things well and according to standards is a high priority because people are at the very center of everything we build.

## I'm focused on:
* Writing clean, readable and usable code
* Learning and comforming to industry standards
* Human-centered approach to coding and teamwork
