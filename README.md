# Hi there 👋 I'm Lizz (they.them), a fellow code nerd 🤓 🌈 

## About 
I'm on a mission to prove that people without a traditional four-year education can excel in the tech industry. I believe that user experience and accessibility advocates need strong allies in web developers, devs who believe that making things well and according to standards is a high priority because people are at the very center of everything we build.

I'm focused on:
* Writing clean, readable and usable code
* Learning and comforming to industry standards
* Coding delightful web experiences
* Product vision and big picture thinking
* Human-centered approach to coding and teamwork

## What I Care About 💕 📚 

### Empathy

For me, everything comes down to the humans we work with and build products for. 

### Learning 

I'm a life long learner and I value curiosity, cultivating positive learning cultures, and advocating for a growth mindset. I think the best question we can ask is "why?". 
 
### Community 

A true community is diverse and lifts people up beyond the potential they see in themselves. 

### Playfulness 
We should never take ourselves too seriousy and play is essenital for a truly joyful life, and definitely has a place in the workplace.
