# Hi there 👋 I'm Lizz (they.them), I'm a wholesome weirdo and fellow code nerd 🤓 🌈 

I'm on a mission to prove that people without a traditional four-year education can excel in the tech industry. I believe that user experience and accessibility advocates need strong allies in web developers, devs who believe that making things well and according to standards is a high priority because people are at the very center of everything we build.

I'm focused on:
- Writing clean, readable and usable code
- Learning and comforming to industry standards
- Coding delightful web experiences
- Product vision and big picture thinking
- Human-centered approach to coding and teamwork
