# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lizz (they.them), a fellow code nerd ðŸ¤“ ðŸŒˆ 

I'm on a mission to prove that people without a traditional four-year education can excel in the tech industry. I believe that user experience and accessibility advocates need strong allies in web developers, devs who believe that making things well and according to standards is a high priority because people are at the very center of everything we build.

I'm focused on:
- Writing clean, readable and usable code
- Learning and comforming to industry standards
- Coding delightful web experiences
- Product vision and big picture thinking
- Human-centered approach to coding and teamwork

## My Core Values ðŸ’•

**#####Empathy**

For me, everything comes down to the humans we work with and build products for. 

**#####Education**

I'm a life long learner, and I value curiosity and a growth mindset.
 
**#####Community**
A true community is diverse and lifts people up beyond the potential they see in themselves. 

**#####Fun**

We should never take ourselves too seriousy and play is essenital for a truly joyful life.
